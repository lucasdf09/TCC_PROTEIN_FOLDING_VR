The punctuation is calculated from the difference between the calculated potential energies.
When a New Game is started the potential energy of the structure is calculated and stored.
Then, each time the structure is modified, the potential energy is calculated again. 
From the diference between the initial energy and current energy, the score is obtained.
The score formula is: Score = Initial Energy - Current Energy.
If the score is positive, the current energy is less then initial energy.
Else if the score is negative, the current energy is greater then initial energy.
The positve score is represented in green and the negative in orange.
