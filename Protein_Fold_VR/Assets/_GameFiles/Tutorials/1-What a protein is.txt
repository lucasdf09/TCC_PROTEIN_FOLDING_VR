The proteins are essential molecules to life.
This molecules are formed by a linear chain of organic compounds called amino acids.
They are formed by a carbon atom linked with an amine, an hidrogen, a carboxyl and an organic radical.
The associated radical is what differs one amino acid from another.
The proteogenic amino acids are only twenty.
The combination of this twenty amino acids can create countless proteins.
In the protein formation process, there is a step known as protein folding.
During this step, the amino acid chain is folded according to its physicochemical interactions with the middle.
At the end of the protein folding process, the final shape of the structure is that with less potential energy.
The final shape of a protein is what determine its biological functionality.
